### Problem Set 2

#### 1. DOM Manipulation

a. Write a function that if entered into the terminal, will convert all text on a Wikipedia page into Pig Latin (look up the rules of Pig Latin).

b. Write an event listener that if entered into the terminal, will give the user the ability to delete any DOM element on the page simply by clicking it.

c. Write an event listener that if entered into the terminal, will, on click, convert any `p` tag on the page into a text input field with its value equal to that of the contents of the `p` tag. These input fields should be accompanied by a submit button that when clicked, will switch the text input field back into a `p` tag, the contents of which should be equal to what was typed into the text input field.

Basically, you are making every `p` tag editable.
